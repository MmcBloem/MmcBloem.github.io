    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Local Functionality:</strong><br>
        All data (e.g., team names, scores, round results) is stored locally to enable features such as score tracking, round summaries, and scoreboards. This data is used exclusively to provide and improve the in-app experience.

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Local Storage:</strong><br>
        All personal and game-related data is stored securely on your device. We rely on your device’s security features (such as passcodes or biometric locks) to protect this data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Security Measures:</strong><br>
        While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure. You are encouraged to use your device’s built-in security measures to help protect your information.
